	<p id="p1" style="font-size:20pt;"><b>The Matrix</b></p>
	<p id="p1" style="text-align:rigth; font-size:14pt;"><a><img src="images/the-matrix-2.jpg" align="left"style="width:300px;height:300px;"></a><blockqoute>The Matrix opens with a shot of a computer screen, indicating that a phone call is being traced, as we overhear the voices on the phone line discussing whether they have found “the One.” Policemen enter a motel room and confront one of the parties to the phone call: Trinity, a leather-clad, renegade computer hacker. Trinity dispatches them all with gravity-defying kung-fu moves. Reinforcements arrive in the form of Agents, men in business suits with ear radios and sunglasses, who commandeer the scene and try to capture Trinity. They pursue Trinity through a nameless city, and both the Agents and Trinity reveal themselves to be more than human. They sprint over abandoned rooftops and leap over city blocks, and Trinity dives through a window across streets. The chase ends inside a phone booth on a secluded street. Trinity answers a ringing phone and disappears. The Agents remark on her mysterious disappearance and discuss the next target, Neo. Next, a garbage truck, driven by an Agent, destroys the booth. When a beautiful stranger leads computer hacker Neo to a forbidding underworld, he discovers the shocking truth--the life he knows is the elaborate deception of an evil cyber-intelligence.Thomas A. Anderson is a man living two lives. By day he is an average computer programmer and by night a hacker known as Neo. Neo has always questioned his reality, but the truth is far beyond his 	imagination. Neo finds himself targeted by the police when he is contacted by Morpheus, a legendary computer hacker branded a 	terrorist by the government. As a rebel against the machines, Neo must confront the agents: super-powerful computer programs devoted to stopping Neo and the entire human rebellion.</blockqoute></p></blockqoute>

	<p id="p2" style="font-size:20pt;"><b>Wonder Woman '84</b></p>
	<p id="p2" style="text-align:rigth; font-size:14pt;"><a><img src="images/wonderwoman.jpg" align="left"style="width:300px;height:300px;"></a>The film begins with a flashback to when Diana Prince (Lilly Aspell) is a young girl on Themyscira Island. Diana is competing in a multi-stage athletic competition against much older Amazons and holding her own. Diana takes a short cut during one of the competitions and is subsequently disqualified. Queen Hippolyta (Connie Nielsen), Diana’s mother, and Antiope (Robin Wright), Diana’s aunt, lecture her on the importance of truth. The film then flashes forward to 1984, sixty-six years after the events of the first Wonder Woman film. Diana works as a senior anthropologist at the Smithsonian Institute in Washington D.C. She specializes in the culture of ancient Mediterranean civilizations. At work, Diana makes a new friend in the form of co-worker, Barbara Ann Minerva (Kristen Wiig). Barbara is extremely insecure and idolizes Diana. She works hard to develop a friendship with her. On the side, Diana continues to fight crime as Wonder Woman, but manages to stay out of the public eye and does not draw attention to herself. In this second installment to 	the Wonder Woman film series, Diana lives amongst the population of 	the world in 1984. Now an anthropologist at the Smithsonian 	Institute in Washington D.C., Diane encounters an ancient artifact 	that has the power to grant the most desired wish of anyone who 	touches it. She also becomes friends with the timid and insecure 	Barbara Ann Minerva. When Diana touches the artifact and restores 	her one true love, Steve Trevor, to life, she also discovers that 	the wish also comes at a cost…Diana’s strength and power. However, 	will Diana choose to have a life with Steve or to continue to be 	Wonder Woman?</p>

	<p id="p3" style="font-size:20pt;"><b>The Karate Kid</b></p>
	<p id="p3" style="text-align:rigth; font-size:14pt;"><a><img src="images/thekaratekid.jpg" align="left"style="width:300px;height:300px;"></a>"The Karate Kid" was directed by John G. Avildsen, who made "Rocky." It ends with the same sort of climactic fight scene; Daniel faces his enemies in a championship karate tournament. But the heart of this movie isn't in the fight sequences, it's in the relationships. And in addition to Daniel's friendship with Miyagi, there's also a sweet romantic liaison with Ali (Elisabeth Shue), who is your standard girl from the right side of town and has the usual snobbish parents. Daniel and his mother move from New Jersey to California. She has a wonderful new job, but 	Daniel quickly discovers that a dark haired Italian boy with a 	Jersey accent doesn't fit into the blond surfer crowd. Daniel 	manages to talk his way out of some fights, but he is finally 	cornered by several who belong to the same karate school. Macchio is an unusual, interesting choice for Daniel. He's not the basic handsome Hollywood teenager but a thin, tall, intense kid with a way of seeming to talk to himself. <br>As Daniel 	is passing out from the beating he sees Miyagi, the elderly 	gardener leaps into the fray and save him by outfighting half a 	dozen teenagers. Miyagi and Daniel soon find out the real motivator 	behind the boys' violent attitude in the form of their karate 	teacher. Miyagi promises to teach Daniel karate and arranges a 	fight at the all-valley tournament some months off. When his 	training begins, Daniel doesn't understand what he is being shown. 	Miyagi seems more interested in having Daniel paint fences and wax 	cars than teaching him Karate.</p>

	<p id="p4" style="font-size:20pt;"><b>Captain Marvel</b></p>
	<p id="p4" style="text-align:rigth; font-size:14pt;"><a><img src="images/captainmarvel.jpg" align="left"style="width:300px;height:300px;"></a>The first film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe with a female superhero at its center and a woman serving as a co-director and writer. These are unprecedented, exciting and long overdue achievements all around within a pop-culture powerhouse that’s long been dominated by male stories and storytellers.

So why does “Captain Marvel” feel like a bit of a disappointment? It’s fine and often quite funny. It fits securely within the MCU but also functions sufficiently as a stand-alone entity. But the character, and the tremendous actress playing her in Oscar-winner Brie Larson, deserved more than fine. They—and the girls and women everywhere looking to “Captain Marvel” with wide eyes and high hopes for seeing themselves on screen—deserved a game-changer along the lines of “Black Panther” or even “Guardians of the Galaxy” or “Doctor Strange.”  <br>Carol Danvers becomes one of the universe's most powerful heroes when Earth is caught in the middle of a galactic war between two alien races. After crashing an experimental aircraft, Air Force pilot Carol Danvers is discovered by the Kree and trained as a member of the elite Starforce Military under the command of her mentor Yon-Rogg. Six years later, after escaping to Earth while under attack by the Skrulls, Danvers begins to discover there's more to her past. With help from S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Nick Fury, they set out to unravel the truth.</p></br>

	<p id="p5" style="font-size:20pt;"><b>No Time To Die</b></p>
	<p id="p5" style="text-align:rigth; font-size:14pt;"><a><img src="images/notimetodie.jpg" align="left"style="width:300px;height:300px;"></a>Daniel Craig‘s James Bond era is the saga of a man eternally in the need of a break. Craig’s 007 has attempted to retire numerous times before, and his latest effort to leave the espionage world forever at the beginning of No Time to Die will inevitably also fail. But how exactly did they pull him back in? New No Time to Die plot details reveal the reason that Bond is back for one more go-around (and a last one for Craig), and what it has to do with Chrisotph Waltz’s returning Spectre villain Blofeld. <br>James Bond has left active 	service. His peace is short-lived when Felix Leiter, an old friend 	from the CIA, turns up asking for help, leading Bond onto the trail 	of a mysterious villain armed with dangerous new technology.</p></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>

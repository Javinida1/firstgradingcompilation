<h4><b>Overview:</b></h4>
<p style="font-family:Tahoma; text-align:center;">
Economic and population growth further signal the dire need to invest more in modernizing digital infrastructure, which has only been accelerated by the pandemic.
Speedtest Global Index documents Philippine mobile internet speed at 14.24 Mbps (global average 30 Mbps) and fixed broadband speed at 23.80 Mbps (global average 74.64 Mbps). For many years, internet speed in the Philippines ranked lower than Syria, and was the slowest in Asia. Cellular coverage is spotty at best, due to a long lasting duopoly between two major players that have not encouraged investment in the sector. The nation of 109 million people and 7,000 islands only has 20,000 towers. Regulatory change is expected to allow for a third player and for common towers, but the vested interests have close relationships with the Government in order to craft policies to their advantage.Government processes are papercentric, requiring the submission of physical documents even after taxes or other paperwork is filed online. That being said, digitization efforts had been called for and should progress due to the pandemic. However, the Government will need funding and masterplanning assistance to set standards and implementation procedures for ICT solutions. The Department of Information and Communication Technology was formed in 2016, but has been unable to set nation wide standards or lead on policy issues due to a variety of causes including frequent staff turnover. 

Recognizing the challenges and realities above, the Duterte Administration’s goal is to embark on a digital transformation program to innovate government agencies. Immediate priorities include a cloud data center, software development for business process improvement, the conversion of local government units into smart cities, cybersecurity solutions for data privacy protection, and improving the internet and mobile services landscape through a national broadband plan.

The Philippines’ growing middle class and the young population are also important drivers of IT demand because their spending levels on technology products are on an upward trajectory, benefitting premium brands. Infrastructure investments in the Philippines are another source of opportunity. The road, railway, airport, bridge, and port systems built will require, at a minimum, design software, building information modeling (BIM) for better project management, and file-sharing applications. These will drive demand for hardware, software, and services.

The Philippine Government, the business process outsourcing (BPO) industry, the financial sector, health, education, and the telecommunications industry are key vertical markets for IT. The Philippine Government showed its strong support for the industry by establishing its own Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT) in 2016. Details on the DICT’s projects are listed under “Market Opportunities.”</p>
